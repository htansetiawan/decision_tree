# Decision Tree Classifier

An implementation of Decision Tree classifier that recursively partitions data into smaller and smaller subsets until each subset is pure. It works by calculating impurity of
the root node and selecting the best feature and threshold to split the data at the node. The algorithm then creates two child nodes and recursively calls itself on each child node until all leaf nodes are pure.
